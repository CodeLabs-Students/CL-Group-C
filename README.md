# CL-Group-C
# **Angular 19+ Group Project**

## 📚 Overview

For the remainder of the front-end course, you will work in **groups of three** to design and build a full-featured Angular 18+ application. This is more than a static website — your project should be **dynamic, interactive**, and reflect real-world development practices.

While creativity is encouraged, the main focus is **execution and delivery**. This is your chance to simulate working on a real dev team with clear expectations, structure, and professional habits.

## ✅ Core Requirements

Your project **must include** the following features:

- **CRUD Operations**  
  Users should be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data in your app.

- **API Integration**  
  Use a real backend — either a public API or one you create (e.g., Firebase, JSON Server, Express).

- **Component-Driven Architecture**  
  Use modular, reusable components to structure your application.

- **Routing & Navigation**  
  Implement multiple views using Angular Router.

- **State Management**  
  Use Angular Signals or RxJS to manage shared state and data flow.

- **Form Handling**  
  Include Template-Driven or Reactive Forms with proper validation.

- **Authentication**  
  Implement login/logout functionality, ideally using JWTs or similar secure authentication flows.

- **Error Handling**  
  Handle API errors and user input issues gracefully with clear messaging.

- **Local Storage**  
  Store relevant data (e.g., user sessions, preferences) in local storage where appropriate.

- **Styling & UI**  
  Your UI should be responsive and well-designed. Use Angular Material, Tailwind, prebuilt Figma designs, or AI-generated layouts for a professional look.

- **Performance Optimization**  
  Apply Angular best practices like OnPush change detection to keep the app efficient and fast.

## 🧠 Strategy & Expectations

- **Pick a Realistic, Original Idea**  
  Focus less on inventing something brand new and more on building something **well**. Your project should reflect the kind of work you might do in a real job — executing tasks within a defined scope.

- **Feature-First Thinking**  
  Define **clear, concrete features** up front. Break your idea down into specific user-facing functionalities and internal components.

- **Use Prebuilt Design Resources**  
  Save time and improve polish by starting from **Figma templates, UI kits, or AI-assisted mockups**. The goal is not to reinvent design — it’s to deliver a clean, functional app.

- **Coach = Project Manager**  
  Your code coach (instructor) will act as your project manager. Tasks will be **assigned based on your strengths and weaknesses**, with a focus on balanced learning and collaboration.

- **Daily Standups**  
  Every class will begin with a **stand-up check-in** with your group. Be ready to share what you worked on, what you're working on next, and any blockers.

- **Deployment Required**  
  Your project must be **deployed online** and accessible via a public URL. You may use tools like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## 📦 Deliverables

- **Project Proposal**  
  Submit a short document describing your project idea, its core features, and the API you plan to use.

- **GitHub Repository**  
  All code should live in a shared GitHub repo:
  - Commit early and often with clean, descriptive messages.
  - Protect the `main` branch.
  - Use **feature branches** and **pull requests** for collaboration.

- **Final Presentation**  
  Each group will demo their project at the end of the course. This is your chance to show off your work and explain the decisions you made.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Form Your Group**  
   Teams of three (or as close to that as possible).

2. **Brainstorm & Break Down**  
   Decide on your project and break it into concrete features/components.

3. **Set Up the App**  
   Use `ng new project-name` to create your Angular workspace.

4. **Divide & Conquer**  
   Assign work based on strengths and learning goals. Collaborate — don’t isolate.

5. **Design Efficiently**  
   Choose prebuilt designs or generate one with Figma/AI.

6. **Build, Test, Iterate**  
   Communicate frequently, support each other, and write clean, modular code.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

This project is a chance to practice real-world front-end development, team collaboration, version control, and deployment. Think like a team of professionals and aim to **deliver a solid, finished product**.
